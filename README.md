Oh man, just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Nonnas and it's like a culinary rollercoaster, you know? The way those old ladies handle their dough, it’s like witnessing magic. Seriously, their fingers just fly and everything looks so effortless—makes me question my whole life as a pastry chef. I mean, am I a fraud?? 😂

Anyway, the whole time I'm sitting there like, should I just give up making croissants and move to Italy to learn their wizardry? It’s so weird, right? Those grandmas deffo have the secret sauce or something. Can you imagine 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   and just pausing every five minutes to try and learn their tricks? Like, Hey Grandma Giovanna, spill the beans, please? But nah, I’d probably just end up more confused lol.

> So, I'm thinking of recreating that one lemon tart they showed. Yeah, good luck to me 😅 They made it look like a breeze, tho, just like poof tart magic. My kitchen’s gonna be a warzone again, isn’t it?

But hey, maybe I should just stick to what I know. Dough with sugar and butter, my happy place, right? You can't beat that! Unless you're a nonna, then you totally can. It's hella inspiring, but also kinda like, how many decades will it take for me to get even a bit close to their level? Maybe I need more wine and fewer perfectionist tendencies. Like, who cares about perfect edges... except me. I totally care lol.

Anyway, if you haven't seen it yet, you gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . It's like therapy but with more carbs. Let's be real, who needs therapy when there's carbs. Just kidding, I probably still need both.

But yeah, let's catch up soon! I need some real talk outside my pastry-induced existential crisis 😂
